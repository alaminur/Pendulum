INTRODUCTION
This program was created as a teaching assistant for teachers who are trying to show students how pendulums undergo simple harmonic motion. 
This can accurately display the pendulum in motion and the program will also draw a graph according to the velocity and acceleration, which is useful for comparing the two values to each other.

KEY CONTROLS
S - Control whether the system is running or stopped
R - Resets the values of the pendulum to restart the system
<- - Moves the drawn graph along its own axis to the left
-> - Moves the drawn graph along its own axis to the right

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
The system requirements information on this page represents a subset to provide overview of supported browsers and operating systems. 
 Windows 8+ (Desktop)
 Windows 7
 Windows Vista SP2
 Windows XP SP3 (32-bit); Windows XP SP2 (64-bit)
 Windows Server 2008
 Windows Server 2012 (64-bit)
 RAM: 128 MB; 64 MB for Windows XP (32-bit)
 Disk space: 124 MB
If the computer in use fails to meet these required specifications the program may 
struggle to open and/or run.
Without these requirements you may experience a significant drop in the programs 
frame rate and because the program uses values directly from the computer the 
program may display inaccurate results, for the pendulum and the drawn graph.
